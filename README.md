Projects related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) Course
1. **Project Name**:  `News Classification`
2. **Team**: `Ahmed Abdelnasser` ,`Mikel Somael`,`John Ashraf`,`Abdelrahman Said`,`Mahmoud Samy`
3. **Description**: In this project, we focus on developing a neural language processing system for
classifying news articles as either real (1) or fake (0). The project utilizes a
comprehensive dataset of news articles to train and evaluate various machine
learning models.
4. **Installation**: load the csv file , and apply the preprocessing techniques and use this feature extractions teachnique ( Count Vectorizer , N-grams , TF-IDF , One-hot Encoding , Hash vectorizing , Tokenizer )
5. **Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models in Project**: The project uses four types of machine learning (Random Forest , Logistic Regression , Naive Bayes , Linear SVM ) and two deep learning model (LSTM and PyTorch) for different tasks.
6. **Results** The performance is above 94% and we calculate the ROC-Curve, a confusion matrix and (accuracy, precision, Recall and F1-score).
